# 1.0 Critiques of the graph

The original visualisation can be seen below.

![](img/original.png){width=50%}


## 1.1 Clarity

* **Reference line**. There is a lack of reference lines. Although we could know which country or region has a larger total amount, we can not tell the details of export and import.



## 1.2 Aesthetics

* **Color**. Too many colors and some similar colors . Too many colors may cause confusion. In addition, there are some similar colors. For example, the colors of Mainland China are similar to the background, and the colors of EU and Thailand are indistinguishable.
* **Color**.

# 4.0 A step-by-step description of how the data visualization was prepared

|No     |Step         |Action|
|:-----:|:------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
|1|Use Excel to delete redundant data. As we also consider the Europe Union, keep data from EU countries.There're 34 country/region left.|![](img/step-1.png){width=90%}|
|2|Add missing country of EU to T1 and T2|![](img/step-2.png){width=90%}|
|3|Use Tableau to import data and connect T1 and T2 with country|![](img/step-3.png){width=90%}|
|4|Pivot the data of all dates in both T1 and T2|![](img/step-4.png){width=90%}|
|5|We got three columns of data. Change the name of each column.|![](img/step-5.png){width=90%}|
|6|Export both data sites to csv.|![](img/step-6.png){width=90%}|
|7|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-7.png){width=90%}|
|8|Import the data into Tableau,change into correct data types.|![](img/step-8.png){width=90%}|
|9|Custom split the Country/Region column|![](img/step-9.png){width=80%}|
|10|We got two new column which represent for Country and what the value is in.|![](img/step-10.png){width=80%}|
|11|Create calculation field to make all value in million but not thousand.Do the same to Export|![](img/step-11.png){width=80%}|
|12|Hide redundant vales, we got these four columns for further analysis.|![](img/step-12.png){width=90%}|
|13|Create group of Country/Region to devide country of Europe Union.|![](img/step-13.png){width=80%}|
|14|Create a group with ten regions and one EU  group.|![](img/step-14.png){width=90%}|
|15|Create a group with EU countries and one other region group. |![](img/step-15.png){width=90%}|
|16|Drag Import to columns and export to rows|![](img/step-16.png){width=70%}|
|17|Drag Country/Region(10 country/region) to details and use filter to exclude EU.|![](img/step-17.png){width=90%}|
|18|Then our graph looked like this.|![](img/step-18.png){width=90%}|
|19|Create a new calculation field to calculate the amount of Export minus Import.|![](img/step-19.png){width=90%}|
|20|Create a new calculation field to calculate the amount of Export plus Import.|![](img/step-20.png){width=90%}|
|21|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-21.png){width=90%}|
|22|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-22.png){width=90%}|
|23|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-23.png){width=90%}|
|24|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-24.png){width=90%}|
|25|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-25.png){width=90%}|
|26|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-26.png){width=90%}|
|27|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-27.png){width=90%}|
|28|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-28.png){width=90%}|
|29|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-29.png){width=90%}|
|30|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-30.png){width=90%}|
|31|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-31.png){width=90%}|
|32|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-32.png){width=90%}|
|33|Combine the two files.|![](img/step-33.png){width=90%}|
