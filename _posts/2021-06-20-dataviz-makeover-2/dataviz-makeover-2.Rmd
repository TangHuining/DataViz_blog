# 1.0 Critiques of the graph

The original visualisation can be seen below.

![](img/original.png){width=50%}


## 1.1 Clarity

* **Reference line**. There is a lack of reference lines. Although we could know which country or region has a larger total amount, we can not tell the details of export and import.



## 1.2 Aesthetics

* **Color**. Too many colors and some similar colors . Too many colors may cause confusion. In addition, there are some similar colors. For example, the colors of Mainland China are similar to the background, and the colors of EU and Thailand are indistinguishable.
* **Color**.
